# exerciseapp

Web Programming Fall 2018
 The main page will be straight to the point and show the user the remaining calories they have 
for that day. Overall the app will have 4 features:
  1.	Food/Calorie Tracker
  2.	Exercise Tracker
  3.	Set Goals
  4.	Share with Friends
 Food/Calorie Tracker: A basic and straight to the point setup for the calorie tracker will be displayed on the bottom half
of the main page that will, upon being tapped, display the consumed calories.
(e.g., Eggs (fried): 90 calories)
 Exercise Tracker: This will display similarly to meal tracker. The user will input their situps, pushups, and miles ran, and Tracker will display them in a list.
 Set Goals: Users will be allowed to customize their profile to fit their goals. This will be featured on a screen named “My Profile.”
 Share with Friends: When each goal or milestone is completed, users will be given the option to “Share with friends!” 
 Screens:
