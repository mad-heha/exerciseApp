# exerciseApp
Web Programming Fall 2018

The main page will be straight to the point and show the user their overall steps as well as the remaining calories they have 
for that day. Overall the app will have 5 features:
  1.	Step counter
  2.	Food/Calorie Tracker
  3.	Daily Tracking
  4.	Set Goals
  5.	Share with Friends
Step Counter: A very basic step counter will be displayed on the top half of the main page. Once tapped, it will open a screen 
that will shows the user’s daily steps, as well as their trend of steps for the past week. It will also show the calories burnt
and the longest time active/inactive.

Food/Calorie Tracker: Again a basic and straight to the point setup for the calorie tracker will be displayed on the bottom half
of the main page that will, upon being tapped, display the goal calories for the day, the consumed calories, the burnt calories,
and the remaining calories. This will also mainly display the food input, so it will display the meals input for that day (allowing 
the user to input different foods for each meal and display the calories consumed for each meal, e.g., Breakfast: 342 calories, Eggs
(fried): 90 calories). Users will be allowed to save meals for future reference.

Daily Tracking: This will be basically be a screen that displays a calendar. The calendar immediately displays the overall number
calories for that day. Once a specific day is tapped, it will show the steps/exercise and the meals consumed for that day. Users
can leave comments and add comment for days. Users can also choose to view the week/month/year that displays the calorie trends
overtime.

Set Goals: Users will be allowed to customize their profile to fit their goals. This will be featured on a screen named “My Profile.”
They will input their starting weight, current weight (that will ideally be updated weekly – a reminder will be shown to users to 
input that data), goal weight, meals goals (fat, carbs, protein, water), exercise goals (calories burnt), overall daily calorie 
goal, and also upload photos (to record body fat loss). 

Share with Friends: When each goal or milestone is completed, users will be given the option to “Share with friends!” This will be 
displayed on a public blog post where added friends can comment and like posts. Users are also allowed to make their own posts where 
they can share motivational posts/recipes and ask for advice. I don’t think I will feature any private messaging. All of the posts 
will be displayed in the “My Friends” tab, which opens a screen to the most recent posts by their added friends. Users will also need 
a screen where they can make/type their own posts.
